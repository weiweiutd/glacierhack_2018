# The problem
- Can we quantify inter-annual changes in digital elevation models that represent glacial mass balance?
- Can we improve upon time series analysis methods cappturing changes in digital elevation models (DEMs)?
- What can we learn from image analysis and statistical methods (machine learning), applied to this 4 dimensional array?
- How do our solutions perform at scale? Can we leverage the xarray stack and processing power of a Pangeo? Pangeo is a kubernetes powered jupyterhub configuration that enables distributed data processing and analysis through dask and xarray.

# Relevance (So What? - Application Example)
- Predict the fate of glaciers and impact for water resource management. 
- Explore if methods developed for this dataset can be applied to other glacier systems, such as glaciers that experience periodic surges. 
- Learn new data science methods.

# Dataset
[Khumbu Time Series](https://github.com/geohackweek/glacierhack_2018/wiki/Dataset)

# Specific Questions
- Can we quantify inter-annual changes in digital elevation models that represent glacial mass balance?
- Is the trendfitting of glacial mass change robust to systems that experience high variability? (What kind of math makes sense?) -- math folks
- Can we improve upon time series analysis methods cappturing changes in digital elevation models (DEMs)?
- What can we learn from image analysis and statistical methods (machine learning), applied to this 4 dimensional array?
- How do our solutions perform at scale? Can we leverage the xarray stack and processing power of a Pangeo? Pangeo is a kubernetes powered jupyterhub configuration that enables distributed data processing and analysis through dask and xarray.
- How much water is being released / added to the system?
- Can we calculate velocities from changes in elevation and create a velocity map/vector field for the glacier?

# Proposed methods/tools

## Tools/Libraries
