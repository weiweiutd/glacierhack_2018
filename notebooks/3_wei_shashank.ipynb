    "The ASP/VW correlator is fast, memory-efficient, multi-threaded, and generalized. This means it can be used for efficient feature tracking operations on two arbitrary input rasters acquired at different times.\n",
    "It works not only for single pairs, but also can be used for large scale batching processing in a high performane computing environment(Shean et al., 2016)\n",

    "The NASA ASP is a suite of free and open source automated geodesy and stereogrammetry tools designed for processing stereo imagery captured from satellites (around Earth and other planets), robotic rovers, aerial cameras, and historical imagery, with and without accurate camera pose information. It produces cartographic products, including digital elevation models (DEMs), ortho-projected imagery, 3D models, and bundle-adjusted networks of cameras.\n"
