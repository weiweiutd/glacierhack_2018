# Project notes

# Ideas of flow:

- co-registration

- x arrays
  http://xarray.pydata.org/en/stable/

- time series analysis

- Get info/statistics out of that

- visualize


# Git flow:

# all working with the master in personal folder or all working on forks

# We prefer working with a hybrid
# Joachim keeps track of the merges

# Forked glacierhack_2018

git clone https://github.com/LynnKaack/glacierhack_2018.git

# Made my own folder

# how to pull changes from the main folder, upstream is an identifier
git remote add upstream https://github.com/geohackweek/glacierhack_2018.git

git fetch upstream
